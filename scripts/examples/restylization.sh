# EXAMPLE — Video RESTYLIZATION: change the scene AND lighting, preserve the human.
#
# How it works: SAM3 segments the person and grays out the background (scripts/preprocess.sh ->
# preprocessing/orig_pixel.mp4), then the idv2v model regenerates a NEW background/scene + lighting
# around the preserved subject (scripts/infer.sh, single VACE condition = orig_pixel.mp4).
#
# NON-ALIGNED KEYFRAME (feature) uses this SAME command — just set
#   SAMPLE_DIR=test_samples/non_aligned_keyframe/suits   (or .../woman_phone)
# There the stylized_first_frame.png is deliberately a very different scene from the source;
# nothing else about the command changes.
#
# Run from the repo root (fetch weights first: bash scripts/download_checkpoints.sh):
#   bash scripts/examples/restylization.sh

# MODEL_CHECKPOINT is optional: defaults to checkpoints/idv2v.pth (fetched by scripts/download_checkpoints.sh);
# set MODEL_CHECKPOINT=/local/idv2v.pth to use your own.
