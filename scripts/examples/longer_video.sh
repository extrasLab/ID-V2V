# EXAMPLE — LONGER video via chunk-by-chunk generation.
#
# Same idv2v engine; the only change is MAX_NUM_FRAMES = the full source length. The pipeline
# auto-splits into overlapping 81-frame (NUM_FRAMES_PER_CLIP) clips and stitches them
# (240 frames -> 3 clips; adjacent clips overlap 1 frame, and the final clip may overlap more since it is
# anchored to end on the last frame). The chunking is automatic and identical to the short
# examples, which simply resolve to a single 81-frame clip.
#
# Run from the repo root (fetch weights first: bash scripts/download_checkpoints.sh):
#   bash scripts/examples/longer_video.sh
set -e
cd "$(dirname "$0")/../.."
source .venv/bin/activate

# MODEL_CHECKPOINT is optional: defaults to checkpoints/idv2v.pth (fetched by scripts/download_checkpoints.sh);
# set MODEL_CHECKPOINT=/local/idv2v.pth to use your own.
