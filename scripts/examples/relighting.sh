# EXAMPLE — Video RELIGHTING: change ONLY the lighting; preserve the FULL scene (human + background).
#
# How it works: NO preprocessing (no SAM3, no gray) — the RAW source.mp4 is the single VACE
# condition, so lighting is re-rendered from stylized_first_frame.png + prompt.
# Engine: scripts/infer_relighting.sh.
#
# Run from the repo root (fetch weights first: bash scripts/download_checkpoints.sh):
#   bash scripts/examples/relighting.sh
set -e

# MODEL_CHECKPOINT is optional: defaults to checkpoints/idv2v.pth (fetched by scripts/download_checkpoints.sh);
# set MODEL_CHECKPOINT=/local/idv2v.pth to use your own.
